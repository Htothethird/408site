<H2>Welcome to my website!</H2>

to see what I and my colleagues are currently working on.



<H3>About Me</H3>

<DIV align = "justify"><P>Ever since I was young, I have always wanted to be a computer engineer. I have long wanted to design chips like CPUs and 
GPUs, doing what I can to improve efficiency and performance. I am currently in my 4th year at the University of Rhode Island (URI),
 and planning to get my Master's Degree. During my time as a student, I have taken many interesting and informative classes, 
such as: <BR>
</DIV>
<B>Digital Computer Design</B> - One of my personal favorites, we modified the VHDL design of an in-house CPU design in order to make it perform new 
functions, and made new instructions to perform certain tasks much faster. Set a record for low runtime in the final project.<BR>
<B>Intro to Computer Networks</B> - Gives simple, effective explanations and context for how networks function.<BR>
<B>Digital Design with FPGAs</B> - Another personal favorite, we designed many machines in our FPGAs, including a final project to create
what was effectively a TRON cabinet.<BR>
<B>Information and Network Security</B> - Very effective crash course in encryption and security techniques, as well as their uses,
history, and strengths and weakness.<BR>
<B>Embedded System Design</B> - On the same rough trajectory as the Digital Design classes, this class is more about programming on a microcomputer
and interfacing it with an underlying FPGA. Builds heavily on the other two.<BR>
<B>Digital Circuit Design</B> - A quick introduction to how to make the simplest of functional circuits, and how to use them to make 
more complex designs.<BR>

<DIV align = "justify"><P>During time off such as Summer vacation I have had several part-time jobs. Not always related to my education by default,
I have on several occasions found creative ways to use what I have learned at URI. One such job was working at Fidelity Investments,
at their campus up in Smithfield, RI. Many of the small daily tasks done by myself, my team, and especially my boss were repetitive to
the point that it could be broken down into a script of specific copying and pasting of certain lines of text in Excel. It seemed an 
obvious chance to use my coding experience and use MS Office's feature of using Visual Basic for Applications to script functions, 
and make a series of macros to automate hours and hours of work. Some of them were able to complete entire tasks thousands of times
faster than the human using it would have.
